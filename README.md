# Weather Forecast React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Description

Application fetches data from OpenWeather API and displays them. To fetch data you need to replace fake API key in config.json file. You can also choose desired units in mentioned file: "celsius" for Celsius degrees or "fahrenheit" for Fahrenheit degrees.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
